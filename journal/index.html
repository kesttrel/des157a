        <h2>Best Practices for Modals</h2>
        <time>02-07-2023</time>
        <div>
            <p>Modals appear across the web in varying contexts. When I think of modal use, my mind instantly goes to those pesky pop-up ad windows that haunt some of my favorite recipe blogs. Although modals are often poorly designed and create a negative user experience, they can also be useful. As a UI/UX designer, it’s important to understand when it is appropriate to use a modal, and when it is not. 
            </p>
            <p>Baskanderi’s blog post Best Practices for Modals confirms a lot of my feelings about modals and offers parameters for best practices of modal design. It makes sense that modals should not be used for error, success, or warning messages, as a modal would guide the user away from the source of the error. From my understanding of this blog post, modal use is best done when you want to attract the user’s full attention to something, such as confirming that they do want to delete files. In this instance a modal would be helpful as it forces the user to pause and consider, is this the action I am intending to take?

        <h2>Form Design Research</h2>
        <time>01-31-2023</time>
        <div>
            <p>Form design is among the most critical components to good UI/UX Design. This week I began my first full-time job as a UI Designer and Junior Front-End Developer. Guess what I spent most of my time designing and coding? You guessed it, forms!
            From what I've learned this week at my new job, and from the assigned reading, is that good form design comes down to simplicity and clarity. Most people don't like filling forms out, so it's best to make them as easy to understand and fill in.
            </p>
            <p>Signle column grid's provide a better user experience as they limit the amount of information a user needs to process in line by line manner. All input fields should be labeled, with as much information as necessary to guide the user towrds correct information input. It's also important to include placeholder text that disappears when the user selects the box and starts typing. Lastly error messages, often overlooked by beginner UI designers, are essentail to communicating with the user if they're entering information incorrectly.
