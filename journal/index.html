        <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>

            <img src="images/myImg.jpg" alt="My Image" width="400" height="533" class="articleImg">
            <figcaption>Fig.1 - Kestrel, Krystad, Norway</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Part One: This image is intersting to me because it was taken in my first weeks living in Northern Norway. I was being exposed to lot's of new things including boating, fishind, and island hopping to bit multebær, otherwise known as cloudberries in English. This image relate's to the topic of my painting becuase it was memories like this one that inspired me to paint the multebær section of my painting. This tells a story about me because it shows me in a neon boating suit in front of the Fjord at Krystad. Most people do not know that I'm Norwegian since I grew up speaking English primarily and sound very American, so this image and this project overall will show people more of my cultural background to Norway.

        </figure>
        <p>Part Two: This image is interesting to me because it contains a scene the is quite familiar but is not mine, biking in Davis. The most obvious aspect of the image is that it is of two figures biking in Davis by highway 80 (if I'm correct). The road that the subjects are biking on curves to the left and pulls the viewer through the scene and begs the question "where are they going?"

        <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
        <time>02-16-2023</time>
        <p>For this assignment, I chose a website titled “The Female Gaze,” which explores art through the female perspective. This site starts as a landing page with images, and then take you into a 3-d rendered space with a 3-d version of a woman from a painting. It was quite a surprise to be placed into a 3-d space as I was not expecting it. Although I do not indent on using 3-d objects within my Visual Narrative assignment, there is one feature from the website I would like to attempt to replicate on my own. The landing page page has a background image that is zoomed into when you press the “start the experience” button. I would like to have my screen size zoom in when I click on a specific aspect of my background image. It is my intention for my images to start conversations within my family, as all my images are related to Norway and my family there.

        <h2>Best Practices for Modals</h2>
        <time>02-07-2023</time>
        <p>Modals appear across the web in varying contexts. When I think of modal use, my mind instantly goes to those pesky pop-up ad windows that haunt some of my favorite recipe blogs. Although modals are often poorly designed and create a negative user experience, they can also be useful. As a UI/UX designer, it’s important to understand when it is appropriate to use a modal, and when it is not. 
        </p>
        <p>Baskanderi’s blog post Best Practices for Modals confirms a lot of my feelings about modals and offers parameters for best practices of modal design. It makes sense that modals should not be used for error, success, or warning messages, as a modal would guide the user away from the source of the error. From my understanding of this blog post, modal use is best done when you want to attract the user’s full attention to something, such as confirming that they do want to delete files. In this instance a modal would be helpful as it forces the user to pause and consider, is this the action I am intending to take?

        <h2>Form Design Research</h2>
        <time>01-31-2023</time>
        <p>Form design is among the most critical components to good UI/UX Design. This week I began my first full-time job as a UI Designer and Junior Front-End Developer. Guess what I spent most of my time designing and coding? You guessed it, forms!
        From what I've learned this week at my new job, and from the assigned reading, is that good form design comes down to simplicity and clarity. Most people don't like filling forms out, so it's best to make them as easy to understand and fill in.
        </p>
        <p>Single column grid's provide a better user experience as they limit the amount of information a user needs to process in line by line manner. All input fields should be labeled, with as much information as necessary to guide the user towrds correct information input. It's also important to include placeholder text that disappears when the user selects the box and starts typing. Lastly error messages, often overlooked by beginner UI designers, are essentail to communicating with the user if they're entering information incorrectly.
