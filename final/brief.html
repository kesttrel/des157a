    <h1>Final Brief</h1>
    <main>
        <h2>Project Summary:</h2>
        <p>It is my intention to iterate upon Studio 3 with the plan to
        <ol>
            <li>successfully add sound</li>
            <li>add a ‘choose your player’ menu</li>
            <li>hide the rules/instructions within a side panel that pops out from the left.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
        <p>My task oriented goals for this project are to accomplish the three deliverables listed above. My overall goal is to     create a delightful and seamless user experience.</p>
        <h2>Design Strategies:</h2>
        <p>I will be implementing the design system I created for Studio 3. Uploaded with this
            assignment is a PDF copy of that Design system for reference.</p>
        <p>I will be using a tinted range of strong coral pink to off-pink-white. I chose to use pink as
            the main color for this design as it is the only color shared by all the pigs and ties in the
            images. Grey, white, and black will be used as necessary. The black is an off-black to
            decrease intense contrast and user cognitive load.</p>
        <p>I will be using pill/candy shaped buttons to reinforce the rounded, friendly, playful, and
            welcoming tone.</p>
        <p>20px of border radius will be applied to all corners of input fields to further support the
            tone.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I will be using images that I’ve taken at my moms farm to add options for player
            one and player two to be able to choose which pig they’d like to play under.</p>
        <h2>Interaction Strategies:</h2>
        <p>I will include sounds for button clicks, rolls, loss of points from snake eyes, and winning.
            I will also be adding a pop out panel for instructions so that they are always accessible
            but not in the way of the visual design.</p>
        <h2>Experience Goals:</h2>
        <p>My goal is for the user to feel warm and happy, and I am hoping to support this
            experience by my use of design choices, imagery, sound, and usability. I will be adding
            transition hovering and easing to create a visually smooth interactive experience.</p>
