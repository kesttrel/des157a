    <h1>User Test Results</h1>
    <main>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <h3>3 Significant Oberservations that Emerged through Testing:</h3>
        <p>1. It's distracting when the player images that become highlighted by pink when selected jump when a turn is passed. This can be fixed by adding a transparent border to the divs that doesn't show unless it's that players turn. Making this change would solve the jumping issue on the screen</p>
        <p>2. The max-score is not listed in the rules. To help a player know if the game is working correctly, a winning points rule should be added to help the player know when they'll win. Without it and with the bug, users were left to keep playing an infinite game.</p>
        <p>3. The first page should have more content on it, or increase the content that's on it and change the layout to grab the users attention. The play button should be moved center and made larger to make it a clear and enticing call to action. The pig image could also be increased in size and centered.</p>

        <h3>How I Plan to Update my Final Project</h3>
        <p>I will be implimenting the changes listed above, in attion to the following:</p>
        <p>The quit button will be restyled so that it does not match the primary play buttons</p>
        <p>The first screen will include an input for each players name and a place to select their desired pig character. If there is not time for these features, I will increase the header and play button size to make the purpose and CTA more clear.</p>
        <p>I will change the styling to dark mode.</p>
